docker volume 14 

14.00
if the image is already created but i want to give tag then 
$ docker tag (image id) ECRregistrydnsname/repository:tag
now you see here for both image imageid is same .

20.00
now whatever created image we need to push to ECR registry
before push we need to create login pswd for ECR registry 
for that AWS CLI need to install in our server
24.00
but after install and if execute that command also you will not  get pswd.
bcoz this server doesnt have permission to communicate aws resources and manage resources and get the pswd,
so i need to configure permissions to this server to communicate aws resources and manage resources , there are two ways here 1)IAM user 2)IAM role
